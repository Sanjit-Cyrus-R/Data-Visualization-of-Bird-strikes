# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-strikes
## Introduction 
Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aviation safety worldwide, with the potential to cause damage to aircraft and endanger passengers and crew. In this presentation, we will explore the data surrounding bird strikes, analyze trends and patterns, and discuss strategies for mitigating this critical safety concern using innovative data visualization techniques.
Bird strikes represent a complex and multifaceted challenge for the aviation industry. Understanding the frequency, location, and contributing factors of bird strikes is essential for developing effective prevention and mitigation strategies. By visualizing bird strike data, we can identify high-risk areas, recognize seasonal trends, and inform decision-making processes to enhance aviation safety.
